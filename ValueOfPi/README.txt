README.txt

I have provide ten text files to use with the program.

The files each contain 5000 numbers generated by a TRNG.

If you would like to use your own numbers you can save those to a text file.

If you do this you will need to make some minor changes to the code.
	trngNum = initTRNGArray(name_of_your_file);	//located in the first for loop of PiDriver.java
	You will also need to change 
		int runs = number_of_files_you_want_to_test;

Otherwise, you may just compile Pi.java and PiDriver.java with the provided text files and it should run fine.

When you hit run, the program will do the rest.
